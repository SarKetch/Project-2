# What's for Dinner?

## Overview

"What's for Dinner?" is an interactive web application designed to help users solve the age-old question: "What should I make for dinner tonight?" It provides a simple and intuitive interface where users can choose from several mood-inspired options, including a 'Surprise Me' button for those who feel particularly indecisive.

## Features

- **Intuitive Interface:** A clean header and four prominent buttons guide the user through the experience with minimum hassle.
- **Recipe Generation:** Users can generate meal ideas by clicking on the 'Go' button or by simply pressing 'Enter'.
- **Variety of Options:** Although currently limited to six recipes, the 'Surprise Me' feature randomly selects from a larger pool of 18 possibilities for added variety.
- **Responsive Design:** The website is fully responsive and provides a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.

## Planned Features

- **Expanded Recipe Database:** Future implementations aim to source recipes from a broader database, providing users with a greater variety of meal options.
- **Increased Interactivity:** Allowing users to interact with more buttons simultaneously and choose multiple preferences for more tailored results.
- **Ingredient-Based Search:** A planned search feature will enable users to find recipes based on specific ingredients they have on hand or wish to include.
- **Enhanced Presentation:** The visual display of recipes will be refined to include thumbnail images and teaser descriptions, creating a more engaging user experience.

## Testing

### Validator Testing

- **HTML:** No errors found using the W3C Markup Validation Service.
